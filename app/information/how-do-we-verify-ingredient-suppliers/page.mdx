# How do we verify ingredient suppliers?

**Short version:** we validate the supplier’s facility, track record, and documentation, then cross-check real lab results for representative lots—before any listing goes live. We re-verify on a schedule and anytime risk signals appear.

## What we verify

- Facility credentials (e.g., **cGMP/ISO** certificates and validity dates)  
- Quality system & documentation (SOPs, batch records, change control)  
- **Track record** (on-time performance, dispute rate, recall history)  
- Product-level **COAs** for representative lots (potency/identity, heavy metals, microbials; residual solvents/pesticides where applicable)  
- Chain of custody & traceability as required by the ingredient  

> _Goal:_ a supplier can consistently ship lots that meet label claim and safety specs, with documentation that stands up to audit.

## Our verification workflow

1. **Document intake** – certificates, SOPs, specs, and recent COAs are collected.  
2. **Screening review** – check certificate scope/dates; match methods to the ingredient (e.g., **HPLC/UV/FTIR** for identity/potency).  
3. **Sample request (if needed)** – an **anonymous sample** is pulled when additional confirmation is required.  
4. **Independent lab** – sealed samples go to a **U.S. third-party lab** for analysis.  
5. **Cross-check** – lab results must match the supplier’s specs/COA and method suitability.  
6. **Approval & monitoring** – listing goes live; supplier enters our re-audit schedule and watchlist triggers.

## Evidence we collect

| Category | Why it matters | Typical evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Facility credentials | Confirms a baseline quality system | cGMP/ISO certificate (scope, site, expiry) |
| Product specs | Defines pass/fail criteria | Signed specification sheet |
| COAs (recent lots) | Verifies real results vs. spec | COA with **method**, **limits**, **results**, **lab info** |
| Traceability | Supports recalls & origin claims | Batch records; lot coding; country of origin |
| Performance | Predicts reliability | On-time rate; dispute/return rate; CAPAs |

---

## Re-audit cadence & triggers

- **Time-based:** typically **annual** re-review of documents; frequency increases for higher-risk categories.  
- **Event-based triggers:**  
  - abnormal COA results or missing tests  
  - certification lapse/expiry  
  - customer dispute or complaint  
  - regulatory action/recall in the region  
  - major process change at the facility

## How we authenticate COAs

1. **Header check** – supplier, product, lot/batch, date, and tested lab all present.  
2. **Method & units** – appropriate **method** for the analyte (e.g., HPLC for actives; **ICP-MS/OES** for metals) and correct **units/limits**.  
3. **Signatures** – analyst/reviewer signatures or electronic equivalent, plus page count.  
4. **Cross-reference** – lot code matches the packing list and spec revision; math on %/mg g checks out.  
5. **Lab verification** – if needed, confirm the third-party lab is accredited and actually issued the report.

---

## COA red flags to watch

- No **method** listed, or a method that doesn’t make sense for the analyte  
- Results reported without **limits** or units  
- Same numbers repeated across different lots (“copy-paste COAs”)  
- Missing lot/batch, test dates, or signer  
- Metals or microbials **omitted** when they should be present  
- Hand-edited fields without initials/date or reason

> If you hit a red flag on a live listing, request clarification or ask us to **re-test** before purchase.

## Buyer tips (do / don’t)

**Do**
- Ask for **full COAs** per lot (not summaries).  
- Confirm **methods** and units; compare to your internal spec.  
- Keep a paper trail (COAs, emails, purchase docs) tied to **lot codes**.  

**Don’t**
- Assume “pass” means suitable—ensure **limits** match your use case and region.  
- Mix lots in production without reviewing each lot’s documentation.  
- Rely on supplier self-testing alone when the risk profile is high—use an **independent lab**.

## Glossary: common test methods

- **HPLC/UV** – potency/identity for many actives; quantifies specific compounds.  
- **FTIR** – fingerprinting for identity; quick, not a potency method.  
- **ICP-MS / ICP-OES** – heavy metals (Pb, Cd, As, Hg).  
- **Microbial panel** – TPC, yeast/mold, *E. coli*, *Salmonella*; plus pathogens where relevant.  
- **GC/LC residual solvents** – confirms solvent removal to safe limits.  
- **Pesticides / PAHs / ETO** – risk-based, required for certain botanicals or markets.
