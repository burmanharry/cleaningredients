</Callout>

## What you'll learn
- Why this topic matters for sourcing and quality
- What documents/evidence to request
- Minimum acceptance criteria (with examples)

## Key definitions
- *Term 1* â€” buyer-friendly definition.
- *Term 2* â€” concise definition.

## Checklist
- [ ] Required documents collected
- [ ] COA fields present (lot #, method refs, criteria, results)
- [ ] Identity + spec matched
- [ ] Red flags reviewed

## How to do it
1. **Request** baseline docs from the supplier.
2. **Verify** legal entity & facility details.
3. **Review** COA vs acceptance criteria.
4. **Escalate** any mismatches or missing method references.

## Red flags
- Missing method references
- Results without acceptance criteria
- Inconsistent lot/date metadata

## FAQ
**Q:** What if the supplier won't share recent COAs?  
**A:** Ask for anonymized COAs or third-party lab proof. No evidence = unacceptable risk.
