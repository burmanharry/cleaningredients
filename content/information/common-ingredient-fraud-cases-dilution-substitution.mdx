howto:
  name: "Screen a COA for dilution or substitution"
  steps:
    - "Confirm the **lot/batch ID** on COA matches the label, packing list, and invoice."
    - "Check **identity tests** are appropriate (e.g., FTIR/HPLC/GC-MS; no generic ‘meets spec’)."
    - "Compare **assay/potency** vs. normal ranges for the botanical/compound."
    - "Verify **impurity profile** (heavy metals, solvents) aligns with the declared origin/process."
    - "Match **organoleptic** notes (color, odor) with a retained reference sample."
    - "Spot-check with an **independent lab** for high-risk lanes or unusually low pricing."
faqs:
  - q: "What’s the most common fraud pattern?"
    a: "Dilution (active % depressed with cheap filler) and species substitution (look-alike botanicals or analogs). Both are often paired with copied or tampered COAs."
  - q: "Do QR-code COAs solve it?"
    a: "They help with provenance but don’t replace independent identity testing or supplier qualification."
  - q: "Which signals should trigger a third-party test?"
    a: "Outlier price, urgent availability, vague COA methods, or a new supplier on a complex ingredient."

## What “dilution” looks like

- **Potency below market norms** but just inside a broad spec.
- **Excipient fingerprint** (e.g., maltodextrin) not declared but visible in chromatograms.
- **Density/solubility changes** vs. true material.

**Quick check:** ask for **raw instrument output** (chromatograms/spectra), not only summary values.

## What “substitution” looks like

- **Botanical swaps** within a genus (cheaper chemotype).
- **Synthetic analogs** in place of natural actives.
- **Incorrect salt forms** (e.g., Mg chelates vs. oxide).

**Quick check:** require **fit-for-purpose identity methods** (e.g., DNA/barcoding for botanicals, chiral/marker testing for actives).

## COA tampering patterns

- Cropped pages, inconsistent fonts, missing lab address/accreditation (ISO/IEC 17025).
- Stale **report dates** vs. harvest/manufacture dates.
- Same COA reused across lots.

> Tip: keep a **COA library** and hash PDFs; duplicates across suppliers pop out fast.

## Controls that actually work

- **Approved methods table** per ingredient (which identity/assay is acceptable).
- **AQL sampling** + periodic **3rd-party re-test** for high-risk SKUs.
- **Supplier scorecards**: audit history, CAPAs closed, lot-to-lot variability.

## Red flags at purchase

- Price >15–20% below your rolling average.
- Vendor pushes pre-paid only, won’t release full COA package.
- “Proprietary method” but no validation summary.

### Templates you can copy

**PO/Contract language (excerpt)**

> Supplier warrants identity and assay per attached specification. Buyer may verify with independent ISO/IEC 17025 lab; failures trigger full refund, return rights, and documented CAPA within 10 business days.

**COA request checklist**

- Method & instrument model  
- LOD/LOQ & uncertainty  
- Sample chain-of-custody  
- Analyst name & lab accreditation
