    a: "Legal entity docs, facility certifications (e.g., cGMP), and a lot-specific COA."

  name: "Verify a new ingredient supplier"
  steps:
    - "Collect legal entity docs and facility certificates."
    - "Obtain a lot-specific COA and verify with the lab."
    - "Check identity/potency, heavy metals, micro, and solvents as applicable."
    - "Confirm traceability and logistics (incoterms, lead times)."

<Callout type="tip">
Verification is about **evidence**. Collect documents that tie back to the **legal entity** and the **facility** making or handling the product, then confirm that batch-level results meet your acceptance criteria.
</Callout>

## What you'll learn
- The baseline document set to request from any supplier
- How to review a COA (and what ‚Äúgood‚Äù looks like)
- A quick scoring rubric to triage risk
- Red flags and escalation paths

---

## 1) Prove the **legal entity**
Ask for documents that establish who you‚Äôre dealing with.

**Request**
- Legal entity name and **registered address**
- Government business registration (or equivalent) with registration number
- Primary domain email (avoid new, generic free-mail accounts)
- Point-of-contact name and role

**Checks**
- Names and addresses match across all documents and email signatures  
- Company website and email domain are consistent (e.g., `@supplier.com`, not `@mail.com`)

---

## 2) Confirm the **facility**
You want evidence for the physical site that manufactures, packs, or stores your lot.

**Request**
- Facility address (street, city, country)  
- Scope of activities (manufacture / extraction / packing / storage)  
- Utility: basic floorplan or flow diagram (optional but helpful)

**Checks**
- Facility address appears on certificates and COAs where appropriate  
- If a trader/broker is involved, capture **chain of custody** (see ¬ß5)

---

## 3) Snapshot the **quality system**
You‚Äôre not auditing‚Äîjust establishing baseline controls.

**Request**
- Current certifications (e.g., **cGMP**, **ISO22000**, **Organic**, **Kosher/Halal** where relevant)  
- Date of last 3rd-party audit (provide summary letter if available)  
- SOP index or list of key procedures (receiving, testing, release, complaints/recalls)

**Checks**
- Certificates are **in-date**, match the **entity**/**facility**, and cover the **scope** you buy

---

## 4) Gather **product-level** documents
You need evidence that the item you‚Äôll buy matches your spec.

**Request**
- **Product specification** (identity tests, acceptance criteria, microbial/heavy metals limits, moisture, actives, etc.)  
- **Safety & compliance**: SDS, allergen/GMO/irradiation statements as applicable  
- **Recent COAs** (see ¬ß6) ‚Äî ask for **three** from different lots if possible

**Checks**
- Spec includes **methods or references** (e.g., HPLC, ICP-MS, FTIR; USP/Ph.Eur./in-house method IDs)  
- Acceptance criteria are numeric and unambiguous

---

## 5) Map **chain of custody** (when not buying direct from the manufacturer)
If a trader or distributor supplies you, capture the lineage.

**Request**
- Manufacturer legal entity & facility address  
- Documentation showing the product moves from manufacturer ‚Üí trader ‚Üí you  
- If repackaged, include repack site address and labels with **lot numbers**

**Checks**
- Lot numbers and product names stay consistent through documents  
- Everyone in the chain is identified

---

## 6) Review the **COA** (Certificate of Analysis)
A usable COA contains enough detail for an independent reviewer to reproduce the conclusion.

**Minimum fields**
- Product name, **lot/batch number**, manufacturing or sampling date  
- **Test methods** (e.g., ‚ÄúHPLC, in-house method QP-HPLC-102‚Äù, or ‚ÄúUSP &lt;561&gt;‚Äù)
- **Acceptance criteria** and **results** for each analyte/test  
- Tested by (lab name), location, and authorized signature (digital is fine)

**Quick read**
- Methods referenced? ‚úÖ  
- Results vs criteria clearly shown? ‚úÖ  
- Microbial/metals/identity present as applicable? ‚úÖ  
- Dates make sense (no post-dated signatures, no impossible timelines)

<Callout type="warn">
If **method references are missing**, or results are listed without **acceptance criteria**, stop and request an updated COA.
</Callout>

---

## 7) Acceptance criteria (buyer baseline)
Use or adapt the following as your go/no-go:

- ‚úÖ Entity & facility identified and consistent across docs  
- ‚úÖ At least one **current** quality certificate covering the relevant scope  
- ‚úÖ Product spec with **explicit methods** and **criteria**  
- ‚úÖ COA(s) include lot number, dated signature, **method references**, criteria, and results  
- ‚úÖ Results meet criteria; no data manipulation (e.g., rounded to pass)  
- ‚úÖ If applicable, chain of custody established

---

## 8) Red flags (escalate or reject)
- COAs with identical results across multiple ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù lots  
- Certificates that don‚Äôt match the entity/facility or are expired  
- Free-mail domains only; no company domain; evasive on facility details  
- COA missing methods or acceptance criteria  
- Lot or date info inconsistent across documents  
- Unwillingness to provide **any** prior COAs

---

## 9) Lightweight **risk score**
Use this to triage suppliers quickly (0=poor, 3=excellent).

| Area | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Documents completeness | Bare | Partial | Most | Full set |
| Evidence quality | Vague | Some methods | Clear methods | Validated/standard |
| Consistency over time | None | 1 COA | 2 COAs | 3+ COAs |
| Integrity signals | Issues | Minor gaps | Clean | Strong

**Pass** if total ‚â• 8 and no red flags. Otherwise **escalate** (request more evidence or run third-party testing).

---

## 10) Supplier email template (copy/paste)
```text
Subject: Evidence request for <Ingredient> ‚Äî <Your Company>

Hello <Name>,

To complete onboarding for <Ingredient>, please share:
1) Legal entity and facility address
2) Current quality certificates (cGMP/ISO/Organic/etc.)
3) Product specification (methods + acceptance criteria)
4) COAs for recent lots (ideally 2‚Äì3), with method references
5) Any applicable statements (allergen/GMO/irradiation)

Thank you,
<Your Name>
